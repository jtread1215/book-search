I was not able to finish this project.
I still need to edit the readme some more. Deploy to Heroku and connect the DB to Mongo.
My tutor tried to help me out by helping with the file structure, routes, and some of the JS.
I still need to add some dependencies as well. 
I just ran out of time to turn in without being incomplete.
